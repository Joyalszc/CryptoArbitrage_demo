# CryptoArbitrage_demo
This is simple demo to understand how cryptocurrency arbitrage works on two exchanges:
First of all let's see what is crypto arbitrage. In simple, it is a trading strategy where you buy crypto coin on one exchange at a lower price and sell it on another exchange at a higher price to draw profit.

## Simple steps:
1. Find two exchanges and a coin or token that has some good price difference on both the exchanges.
2. When there is a good difference, Buy at low price from exchange. For example: $BTC is 40,000 on Exchange A and $40,250 on Exchange B.
3. Now, I place buy order in Exchange A.
4. Soon after I buy, transfer the BTC to Exchange B and sell it at $40,250.
5. Now my gross profit will be $250.
6. After deducting the commissions and trading fee, there will be a net profit of $200.


Example output of our program:
Enter price of Xcoin on Exchange A: 900
Enter price of Xcoin on Exchange B: 990
Enter the trading fee (decimal): 0.001
Arbitrage Profit Percentage: 9.8%
